# Skunk911
"A Quick and Dirty emergency response &amp; contact management system."

In Kenya (and oftentimes Africa), accessing help when in an emergency situation is not just a matter of dialling 911. The structures needed for a coordinated response mechanism are all but gone. 

For example, if stuck in kapsokwony, the phone number for the nearest police station is 0736350155. Nothing you can easily memorize so in event of an emergency can quickly dial. 

Sometimes one does not know where they are, and calling the nearest police station is not an option. The general objective is to develop mobile apps (Android? IOS? ) where users with apps installed in them would have access to a quick database of phone numbers to call in the event of an emergency. 

Specific details will be discussed under Issues, and milestones once set up managed on the same.
